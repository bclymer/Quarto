Quarto
======

HTML5 Quarto game.

I hadn't done much web dev, so I did this to get familiar with some things I wasn't great at.

Things I Used
======
The game itself uses a canvas to draw on.

All the game logic is done server side using Go.

I'm using bootstrap, because design is hard...

Handlebars for partials I use a lot (chat, table rows).

Websockets, which I think are awesome.


Misc
======
I think it only works in Chrome, don't why why, haven't really tested. I might look into it eventually.
